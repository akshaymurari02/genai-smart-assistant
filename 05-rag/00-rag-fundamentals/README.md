## Learning Path

### 1. Understanding RAG Fundamentals
- **What is RAG**: A technique that combines LLMs with external knowledge retrieval to provide more accurate, up-to-date, and verifiable responses
- **Core Components**: Document store, embedding model, vector database, retriever, and generator (LLM)
- **Benefits**: Improved accuracy, reduced hallucinations, domain adaptation, and transparency

### 2. LLM Hallucinations and RAG Solutions
- **Why LLMs Hallucinate**:
  - Limited or outdated training data
  - Pattern completion without factual grounding
  - Confidence in generating plausible but incorrect information
- **How RAG Solves This**:
  - Grounds responses in retrieved documents
  - Provides current and verified information
  - Enables source citation and fact-checking

### 3. RAG Pipeline Deep Dive
1. **Query Phase**: User input processing and understanding
2. **Retrieve Phase**: Finding relevant documents through vector similarity
3. **Inject Phase**: Incorporating retrieved context into prompts
4. **Generate Phase**: Creating responses using combined information

### 4. Vector Databases Explained
- **Purpose**: Efficient storage and retrieval of vector embeddings
- **Key Features**:
  - High-dimensional vector storage
  - Fast similarity search
  - Scalability and performance optimization
  - Index types (HNSW, IVF, etc.)

### 5. Understanding Embeddings
- **Definition**: Dense vector representations of text
- **Properties**:
  - Captures semantic meaning
  - Fixed dimensionality
  - Enables similarity comparisons
- **Creation Process**:
  - Text preprocessing
  - Model encoding
  - Normalization

### 6. Chunking Strategies
1. **Fixed-Size Chunking**:
   - Based on token or character count
   - Simple but may break context
2. **Overlapping Chunks**:
   - Maintains context between chunks
   - Increases storage requirements
3. **Semantic Chunking**:
   - Based on content meaning
   - Preserves logical units
   - More complex to implement

### 7. Similarity vs Keyword Search
- **Keyword Search**:
  - Exact or fuzzy string matching
  - Language dependent
  - May miss semantic relationships
- **Similarity Search**:
  - Semantic understanding
  - Language agnostic
  - Better handles paraphrasing and concepts
