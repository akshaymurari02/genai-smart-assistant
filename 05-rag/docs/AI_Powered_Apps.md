# Vector Databases

A vector database is a specialized database designed to store and query high-dimensional vectors. These vectors, known as embeddings, are numerical representations of unstructured data like text, images, or audio, generated by machine learning models.

### Why are they important for AI?

- **Similarity Search**: They enable efficient and scalable similarity searches. Instead of searching for exact matches, you can find items that are semantically similar. This is crucial for applications like recommendation engines, image search, and RAG.
- **Long-Term Memory for LLMs**: Vector databases can act as a long-term memory for Large Language Models (LLMs), allowing them to retrieve relevant information from vast datasets.

### Examples

- **Pinecone**: A managed vector database built for high-performance AI applications. (Used in this project)
- **Chroma**: An open-source embedding database.
- **Weaviate**: An open-source vector search engine.
- **Milvus**: An open-source vector database for AI applications.

## Building AI-Powered Apps

There are different approaches to building AI-powered applications. This project demonstrates a direct approach without using a framework like LangChain, but it's also possible to use such frameworks.

### Without LangChain (This Project's Approach)

This project is a great example of building an AI application from the ground up. It directly interacts with the APIs of Google Gemini (for embeddings and generation) and Pinecone (for vector storage).

**Pros:**
- **Full Control**: You have complete control over the entire workflow and can customize every part of the process.
- **Fewer Abstractions**: The code is more explicit, which can make it easier to debug and understand.
- **Lighter Dependencies**: You only include the specific libraries you need.

**Cons:**
- **More Boilerplate Code**: You need to write more code for tasks like chaining API calls, managing prompts, and handling data transformations.
- **Slower Initial Development**: It can take longer to build the initial version of the application.

### With LangChain

LangChain is a framework that simplifies the development of applications powered by language models. It provides a set of tools, components, and interfaces that make it easier to build complex applications like RAG systems.

**How it helps:**
- **Chains**: LangChain allows you to "chain" together different components, such as an LLM, a vector store, and a prompt template, into a single, coherent pipeline.
- **Agents**: You can build agents that use LLMs to decide which actions to take.
- **Integrations**: It has a large number of integrations with different LLMs, vector stores, and other tools.

**Pros:**
- **Faster Development**: Pre-built components and chains can significantly speed up development.
- **Simplified Workflow**: It abstracts away much of the complexity of building AI applications.

**Cons:**
- **Less Control**: The abstractions can sometimes make it harder to customize the workflow to your specific needs.
- **Added Complexity**: The framework itself adds a layer of complexity that you need to learn and manage.
