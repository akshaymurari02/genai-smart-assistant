# 🧠 AI App Development Learning Roadmap

This roadmap outlines everything needed to **learn how to build full-stack applications powered by AI**, using pre-trained models like GPT, Claude, Gemini, and tools like LangChain, vector databases, and AI agents.

---

## 🎯 Goal

Learn how to build real-world apps using:

- 🧠 Generative AI (text, image, code)
- 🔁 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- 🤖 AI agents with tool usage and memory
- 🗃️ Vector databases for custom knowledge
- ⚙️ LangChain / LlamaIndex / LangGraph
- 🧩 Integration with full-stack apps (React + Node/FastAPI)

---

## 📚 Phase 1: Core AI Concepts

- [ ] What is Generative AI?
- [ ] What are LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude)?
- [ ] Prompt engineering: system, user, assistant roles
- [ ] Completion vs Chat API
- [ ] What is an embedding?
- [ ] What is a vector database?

📘 Resources:
- OpenAI API Docs
- Prompt Engineering Guide (OpenAI & FlowGPT)

---

## 🤖 Phase 2: Build with LLM APIs

- [ ] Set up OpenAI / Claude API key
- [ ] Build a basic text completion tool
- [ ] Use ChatCompletion to create a chatbot
- [ ] Control responses using temperature and top_p

📘 Learn:
- Streaming tokens
- Token limits
- Cost management

---

## 🔍 Phase 3: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

- [ ] Learn how embeddings work
- [ ] Generate embeddings for documents
- [ ] Store & query embeddings with vector DB (FAISS, Chroma, Pinecone)
- [ ] Inject retrieved data into prompts

📘 Tools:
- FAISS (local)
- ChromaDB (simple + fast)
- Pinecone (cloud)
- LlamaIndex / LangChain for RAG pipeline

---

## 🛠️ Phase 4: Tools, Agents, and Orchestration

- [ ] What is an AI Agent?
- [ ] How tools work with agents (ReAct pattern)
- [ ] Build an agent that can:
  - Use a calculator tool
  - Call external API
  - Access user-uploaded files
- [ ] Build a chain with LangChain or LangGraph

📘 Learn:
- LangChain Agents
- LangGraph (for multi-step workflows)
- Function calling (OpenAI-style)

---

## 🧠 Phase 5: Memory and Multi-turn Chat

- [ ] Understand short-term memory (session-based)
- [ ] Implement context retention
- [ ] Optional: save chat history in MongoDB/PostgreSQL

📘 Tools:
- LangChain Memory
- Redis or DB-based memory

---

## 🧩 Phase 6: Full-Stack Integration

- [ ] Connect React frontend to AI backend (FastAPI or Node)
- [ ] Build a chat UI with file upload
- [ ] Handle user sessions, feedback, and logging
- [ ] Deploy with Vercel + Render

📘 Tools:
- React + Tailwind
- FastAPI / Node.js
- WebSockets or REST
- Railway, Render, or Vercel

---

## 🧪 Phase 7: Logging, Testing, and Guardrails

- [ ] Log prompts and outputs
- [ ] Add retry/fallback logic
- [ ] Set moderation rules or prompt guards
- [ ] Track user feedback (thumbs up/down)

📘 Tools:
- LangSmith (prompt tracing)
- Traceloop
- GuardrailsAI

---

## 🚀 Optional Advanced Topics

- [ ] Voice input/output (Whisper, TTS)
- [ ] Image understanding (GPT-4 Vision, Gemini Vision)
- [ ] Multi-agent collaboration (LangGraph + MCP)
- [ ] Automation workflows with n8n
- [ ] Monetization with Stripe
